# town-of-salem-tool

This is a small bookmarklet widget that allows extremely fast recording of:
- Votes and vote history for all players
- Suspicious players
- Good/evil player roles

It functions by generating a transparent widget that overlays the main play area
and augments the UI.

I'm developing it exclusively for a friend so there are currently no docs at all.
If others become interested in it, shoot me a message and I'll document the current
functionality and how to use it.
